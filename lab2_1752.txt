For a given tree of n points, all edge weights are equal to 1. Then q queries, each time asking what kind of node is from node vi,
print any.

At the beginning, yy reached the diameter of the tree. The endpoint of the longest path that each point can go must be
some end point of the diameter. Then save the points on the diameter,
then check if the TLE is correctly determined when asked if vi is a point on the diameter. ,,

Gxb appeared later, using a two-dimensional array fa to record the path from each point to two breakpoints in diameter.
Since all edge weights are 1, you can use RMQ (Range Minimum Query O (1)) when querying. ,,
gao function: // Make the longest road with RMQ
array fa: parent node entry
Query function: // search RMQ
