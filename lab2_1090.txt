Intention: find inverse ordinal pairs. Print the label of the reverse sequence number in the largest line.
If there are multiple lines, print the line label with the fewest lines.
Divide the interval because the range of each number is 1-N. Definitely less than 10,000.
Divide 10000 by 100 intervals and write down how many values are from 1 to 10000, and then write down,
how many in each interval.
For each value, just know how many of the previous numbers are greater than it.
Each search has a maximum of 100 intervals + 100 values = 200 times.
