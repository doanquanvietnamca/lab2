The job requires replacing the buble_sort function with a faster function
since I use stable_sort to sort the elements in the range [first, last) in ascending order.
The order of equivalent elements is guaranteed to be preserved.
Elements are compared using the <
bool operator < (team X)const{
        return solved>X.solved;
    }
    I suggest using the> sign to not change the place when the 2nd number is equal, since it is guaranteed to be preserved.
