std :: priority_queue are a type of container adapter specifically
designed so that the first element of the queue is the largest
of all the items in the queue, and the items were in non-increasing order.
The first n / 2+ 1 elements are first added to the priority queue.
At this time, the priority queue decreases. After adding each
element the largest element is deleted. After all the items
queued, the largest element is continuously removed since
The last item is deleted. This is the median. (Handle cases where
n odd and even)
