Task
   In the given tree, find the distance between the two nodes.
Problem Solving Ideas
     Taking 0 as the root node, dfs first finds the passed order of nodes and
     corresponding node depth, records the first occurrence of each node in the sequence
     Euler and records the distance from each node to the root node.
     RMQ preprocessing can quickly get the point closest to the root (shallowest depth)
     for a certain interval in the Euler sequence, and then by searching for two nodes u, v the smallest
     depth in the interval where the Euler sequence first appears. The corresponding node is LCA(u, v),
     LCA(Lowest Common Ancestor in a Binary Tree) Given a binary tree (not a binary search tree) and two
     values say n1 and n2, write a program to find the least common ancestor. LCA is best solution in this task
     then the distance between u and v is dis[u]-dis[t].
